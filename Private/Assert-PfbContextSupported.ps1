    .SYNOPSIS
        Builds the capability-map endpoints key for a method and endpoint.
    .DESCRIPTION
        ONE home for this normalization. Assert-PfbApiCapability and the context gates must
        agree byte-for-byte: a second copy that differed by a leading slash would silently
        miss every entry and turn confirmed capability data into "no entry", which the
        capability gate reads as a reason to throw.
